# Solution

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Read an integer from the user
    n = int(input().strip())

    # Check if n is odd
    if n % 2:
        print("Weird")  # If n is odd, print "Weird"
    # Check if n is even and in the range (2, 5)
    elif n > 2 and n < 5:
        print("Not Weird")  # If n is even and in the range (2, 5), print "Not Weird"
    # Check if n is even and in the range (6, 20)
    elif n > 6 and n < 20:
        print("Weird")  # If n is even and in the range (6, 20), print "Weird"
    else:
        print("Not Weird")  # If n doesn't meet any of the above conditions, print "Not Weird"
